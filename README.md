# image-to-cartoon


This project takes any image for input & converts it to it's cartoon/sketch-like form(OR adds a cartoon effect to it).

TIP :- If you don't want the borders in the final image, delete the 'edge mask' section of the project.

This project uses the Python OpenCV library to manipulate images.

And for displaying the resulting images, we are using Matplotlib library.
